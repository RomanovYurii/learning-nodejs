# "Courses shop" application

This application was built by me, [Yurii Romanov](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yurii-romanov/)

Making this application I was learning how to use `NodeJS, ExpressJS, Handlebars, MongoDB with Mongoose` and other useful tools for JavaScript backend development.

Working application is deployed on [Render](https://dashboard.render.com/) and is accessible by the following link: https://learn-nodejs.onrender.com/

### P.S. 
This is not the best application I've ever wrote and most code pieces were written following the tutor. As a matter of fact I already modified several things, such as
- added Prettier for code formatting, 
- used .env file for storing the keys

In real world I would also consider the following changes:
- Switch to `TypeScript` as for such projects it would be incredibly useful to have a type checking process
- Add `Webpack` for build optimization
- Move images folder to some external storage or at least add functionality to delete previous profile images of users

However, as far as this was only the learning pet-project I am not going to deeply optimize or refactor it.
